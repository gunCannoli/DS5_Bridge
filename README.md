  <strong>DS5 Bridge 1.7.0 is live.</strong><br>
  This release includes controller microphone support, Audio Haptics, Trigger
  Lab, controller personas, chords, and companion firmware tools.
</p>

DS5 Bridge lets you use a real Sony DualSense or DualSense Edge controller
wirelessly on a Windows PC through a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W. The controller pairs
to the Pico over Bluetooth, and the Pico plugs into your PC over USB.

The companion app gives you a clean place to adjust audio, haptics, trigger
strength, lighting, button remaps, shortcuts, firmware tools, and other
controller behavior without rebuilding firmware.

## Quick Start

1. Download the firmware `.uf2` and Windows companion installer from
   [Releases](https://github.com/SundayMoments/DS5_Bridge/releases/latest).
2. With the Pico 2 W unplugged, hold `BOOTSEL`, then connect it to your PC.
3. Copy the `.uf2` file onto the Pico drive that appears in Windows.
4. Briefly press `BOOTSEL` once, then wait about one second for the Pico to open
   its controller pairing window.
5. Put the DualSense controller into Bluetooth pairing mode by holding `Create`
   and `PS` until the lightbar rapidly blinks blue.
6. Wait for the controller to pair to the Pico, not directly to Windows.
7. Install and open DS5 Bridge. The Overview page should show the connected
   bridge and firmware version.

Once the controller connects to the Pico, Windows sees it as a normal
DualSense-compatible USB controller.

## BOOTSEL Button Gestures

After DS5 Bridge firmware is installed, the Pico's `BOOTSEL` button controls
controller connections and firmware maintenance:

| Gesture | Action |
| --- | --- |
| One brief press | If no controller is connected, open the controller pairing window. If a controller is connected, disconnect it while preserving its saved pairing. |
| Two brief presses | Reboot the Pico normally. |
| Three brief presses | Reboot into USB firmware flashing mode. The Pico appears as a drive so you can copy a `.uf2` file onto it. |
| Hold for about 1.5 seconds | Forget all saved controller pairings, disconnect the current controller, and open a fresh pairing window. |

A one- or two-press gesture is performed after the Pico waits about one second
to make sure another press is not coming. For a new controller, briefly press
`BOOTSEL` once, wait for the pairing window to open, then hold `Create` and `PS`
on the controller until its lightbar rapidly blinks blue.

## Companion App Tour

The companion app is where you check the bridge, adjust the controller, and save
the setup you actually want to play with.

### Overview

See connection health, firmware version, battery, audio route, Bluetooth signal
quality, host persona, and the settings most likely to matter during play.

</p>

### Button Remapping

Change what each controller button does, then save the remap when you are happy
with it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/app-button-remapping.png" width="680" alt="Button remapping controls in the DS5 Bridge companion app">
</p>

### System

Manage profiles, mute button behavior, polling rate, host persona, diagnostics,
and device repair.

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/readme/app-system.png" width="680" alt="System controls in the DS5 Bridge companion app">
</p>

### Chords

Create reusable keyboard, media, and controller actions, then assign them to
starter chords.

DualSense Edge reserves LFN/RFN plus the face buttons for onboard profile
switching. Enable **Block Edge Profile Switching** in Bridge Settings to use
those combinations as DS5 Bridge chords; turning it off keeps the assignments
saved but inactive.

## Wake-on-LAN

On the Waveshare RP2350B-Plus-W board, DS5 Bridge can wake your PC over Wi-Fi
the moment your DualSense controller connects — no keyboard, mouse, or
Ethernet magic-packet utility needed. This is a separate mechanism from the
existing USB-based "Wake PC on Controller" toggle: that one relies on USB
remote wake and only works while the Pico stays connected to a PC that is
merely asleep, not fully powered off. Wake-on-LAN instead sends a real network
magic packet, so it can wake a PC that's been shut down, as long as the PC's
network adapter has Wake-on-LAN enabled.

### How it works

1. When your controller connects to the Pico, the firmware first checks
   whether the target PC already looks awake over USB (so it never sends an
   unnecessary wake packet, or interrupts you with a lightbar pulse, while
   you're already at your desk with everything on).
2. If the PC looks like it needs waking, the Pico connects to your Wi-Fi
   network using the CYW43 radio it already has onboard for Bluetooth, and
   sends a standard UDP Wake-on-LAN magic packet addressed to your PC's MAC
   address.
3. The firmware watches for the target to come back on the network (via ARP)
   and resends the magic packet a few times if needed, so a single dropped
   packet on a slow-to-associate Wi-Fi network doesn't leave your PC asleep.
4. All of this runs alongside normal Bluetooth/controller operation. A
   missing Wi-Fi network, wrong credentials, or an unreachable target PC never
   blocks or delays controller pairing, input, or audio — Wake-on-LAN is
   strictly best-effort.

### Setup

1. Open **Bridge Settings** in the companion app and find the **Wake-on-LAN**
   section.
2. Turn on **Wake PC over Wi-Fi**.
3. Enter the **Wi-Fi Network** name (SSID) and **Wi-Fi Password** the Pico
   should use to reach your PC's network. This can be the same network your
   PC is on, or any network that can route a magic packet to it.
4. Enter your PC's **Target MAC Address** (`AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF`) — use the MAC
   address of the network adapter you want to wake, not necessarily the one
   currently active.
5. In Windows, make sure Wake-on-LAN is enabled for that network adapter
   (Device Manager → adapter **Properties** → **Power Management** → *Allow
   this device to wake the computer*, and, for wired adapters, the matching
   *Wake on Magic Packet* option in **Advanced**) and that fast startup is
   configured in a way that's compatible with your adapter's wake support.

### Requirements

- Waveshare RP2350B-Plus-W board. Wake-on-LAN firmware builds are gated
  behind this board at compile time (not because other CYW43-equipped
  boards like Pico W/Pico 2 W lack the radio — it's only been built and
  tested on Waveshare so far); other boards simply don't show the
  Wake-on-LAN section in the app.
- A Wi-Fi network that can reach your PC's network segment.
- Wake-on-LAN enabled on the target PC's network adapter and in its BIOS/UEFI
  power settings, and the adapter's wake support has to survive a full
  shutdown (not just sleep) for the "wake from off" case.

## Troubleshooting

- Use the companion app and firmware from the same release when possible.
- For first-time flashing, hold `BOOTSEL` before plugging the Pico 2 W into the
  PC. The Pico should appear as a USB drive.
- Pair the controller to the Pico, not Windows. Hold `Create` and `PS` until the
  lightbar rapidly blinks blue. If the Pico is not already searching, briefly
  press `BOOTSEL` once and wait about one second first.
- If audio, mic, haptics, or flashing behave oddly, try a direct USB port and a
  data-capable micro-USB cable before using a hub.
- If controller audio sounds doubled, distorted, or too loud, restart your PC,
  reopen DS5 Bridge, and run the speaker test again.
- If Windows keeps stale or duplicate controller/audio devices, use
  [Windows device cleanup](docs/windows-device-cleanup.md) or System >
  Emergency Device Repair.
- Battery level may be inaccurate while the controller is charging.

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W.
- Sony DualSense or DualSense Edge controller.
- Data-capable USB cable with a micro-USB end for the Pico 2 W.
- Windows for the companion app.

## Development Notes

- The bridge presents itself to the host as a standard DualSense-compatible USB
  controller for compatibility.
- The companion app requires firmware built with the companion HID interface
  enabled.
- The project controls runtime behavior through the bridge and does not write
  controller-side profiles.
- Battery level is not reported accurately while the controller is charging.
- During development, Windows may keep stale controller or audio endpoint
  records after descriptor testing. Use
  [docs/windows-device-cleanup.md](docs/windows-device-cleanup.md) only if you
  run into device or endpoint issues while testing.
